Introduction To The Problem

ABC Technologies Ltd. wants to develop an application for maintaining information related to its employees transfer and generating the transfer related documents. This application would be facilitating the system administrator (Higher Management) to search the employees transfer record, make new transfers and also amend the allowances offered to the employee, which usually depends on the post of the employee and the type of transfer he is getting.

Existing Scenario

Currently the transfer records are maintained in the computer but there is no fixed format for it. Also the information needs to be shared by releasing circulars to the respective managers and employees and other related staff members (if any).
The information though maintained on computers, entire information can not be found at single place. If higher management wants some details about the transfers, they have to get it from the respective department heads. This becomes time consuming.

Proposed Solution

The management has decided to have a system for managing the transfers which will access a central database. 
This system can be installed on all the machines and the employees will have restricted access levels.
The system will have logins for employees and system administrator. And searching transfer records, updating records, making new transfers etc will be taken care of.
Functional Requirements Following is a list of functionalities of the system. More functionalities that you find appropriate can be added to this list.
